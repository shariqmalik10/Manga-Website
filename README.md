# Manga Website (Work in Progress)

This is a website being created using HTML, CSS and Express to practice calling APIs. In this web application I am calling MangaDex's API to retreive the mangas which match with the title searched by the user. 

## Demo

Here are a few screenshots to showcase what the final website looks like

## How to host the website locally 

### Step 1
Clone the repo  

### Step 2
Go to the cloned repo through da terminal

### Step 3
Run the command ```npm install```. This will install all the dependecies

### Step 4
Run the command ```nodemon index.js``` to locally host the site

## Further Work to be done 
 - [ ] Add a 'read more/read less' in order to make it a more pleasant viewing experience
 - [ ] Add links to the results to redirect user to the website where they can read the manga
 - [ ] Add a dynamic background to the website
 - [ ] Add a background lofi/white noise player
